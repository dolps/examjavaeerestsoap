<h1>Theory Questions/Answers</h1>

<h2>
    1)Explain the main differences between JPQL and SQL,
    and why one might rather want to use JPQL when developing JEE programs
</h2>

<p>
    JPQL has its roots in the sql syntax and can be thought of as a kind of abstraction for developers
    the main difference is that sql results are obtained in the
    form of rows and columns whereas jpql can return both entities or collection of entities.

    syntax can also make more sense and be easier read for a programmer with little sql experience since your dealing
    with domain models and not table structures so its easy to get data by querying the entities attributes.

    what is also nice with jpql is that you can create new objects based on a query in the same query
</p>

<h2>
    2) In the context of JPA, explain the main differences between a “pessimistic” and an “optimistic” lock, and when
    one might choose to use one of them instead of the other.
</h2>

<p>
    The pessimistic lock is a much more heavier type of lock than the optimistic, and its value lies where
    you really need concurrency handling, where you have loads of transactions.
    Optimistic locks are used when most transactions dont conflict with each other. The decision to lock on the entity
    is made at the end of the transaction and violations will fire a optimistic lock exception and then be rolled back.

    While the optimistic locks at the end of the transaction a pessimistic lock is used from the start,
    and locks up more of the resources.
    The optimistic lock has better performance and its easy to implement by eg adding a @Version number to the entity
    the container handles optimistic locking for you.

<h2>
    3) In the context of EJB, explain what “Dependency Injection” is, how it works, and why it is useful.
</h2>

<p>
    Dependency injection is all about inversion of control meaning that a lot of logic is handled by the container.
    Instead of a object asking for other instances, instances are injected into the object, and the implementation can
    be controlled from outside the entity. that gives you loose coupling as well as easier mocking.
    When we inject a EJB into our controllers the ejb is not configured by the controller so configuration is controlled
    from the outside. The ejb's are just extensions of a managed bean, but their functionality which can easily be
    set by annotations or xml saves a lot of the developers time and gives functionalities like transaction
    handling and security. When a ejb is injected its usually a proxy that gets injected, so that we dont get any
    concurrency
    issues even though injecting an ejb into multiple controllers. That is not true for the singleton though but,
    that is preconfigured to handle concurrency issues without the developer specifying it.
    Specifying stateless beans for example creates a pool of beans that can be reused which is very efficient.
    when injecting and giving the control to the container the container also handles the beans lifecycle and you
    can also tap into the different cycles like postconstruct and predestroy.
</p>

<h2>
    4) In the context of EJB, explain the concept of “Proxy class”, how it works, and why it is useful.
</h2>

<p>
    The proxy is what makes the security handling and transaction handling and so on work on your implemented ejbs, so
    inbetween the developer written code is executed all that other logic that the container handles is executed,
    configured by the metadata provided through the annotations or xml. the proxy kind of works ass a pass through to
    the
    real object. creating an instance work kind of like the factory pattern and the reference to the object is saved, so
    we
    can register events like method calls to decide what will happen when executing the different logic. Each proxy
    instance
    has an invocation handler that adds this value. There is essentially a huge abstraction done by the framework.
</p>

<h2>
    5) In the context of JSF, explain the differences and relation between the XHTML files in the “webapp” folder and
    the actual HTML files rendered on the browser when one accesses those files via a JSF servlet
</h2>
<p>
    html and jsf has its simularities but jsf is a much more strict and rich language, that can combine code with static
    text, its components has to be translated by a renderer since the browser dont understand how to interpret jsf
    components. interactions with the server side(the java code) is handled through the faces servlet, the rendering is
    not invoked unless we map the .jsf urls to be handled by the servlet. jsf applications are eventdriven that means
    that f.eks
    form submission fires a http call against the servlet packaged with a event object so action listeneres can listen
    to and respond to the context. As an example i have taken use of the Valuechange event in my exam and used together
    with listdatamodel to get information on the users interactions.
</p>

<h2>
    6) In a Maven project, explain the steps required to configure automated testing with Selenium, as done in class
    (eg., what needs to be configured, which Maven phases are involved, why the tests have to be written as integration
    instead of unit tests, how to automatically get and install a JEE container, etc).
</h2>

<p>
    Selenium must be declared as a dependency, this includes the classes that can handle interaction with the website,
    like the Webdriver, Webelement classes and functions for finding elements on a website(Can be used as a crawler to
    collection information so not only for testing).
    we need the maven failsafe plugin to run the integration tests and also a container to run them in, f.eks the
    wildfly container we use, so we also need to specify a wildfly plugin, setting where to download it, which phases it
    should run, goals and so on. We would also need the maven dependency plugin with enables us to unpack/copy the
    artefacts(used to download/install wildfly in our projects)
    The phases that are included are everything from compiling the source code to post- integration test, to generate
    the
    docs for jacoco we would also include the verify phase.
    The pre and the post integration is important as it will start the container and shutdown after integration step is
    complete. That is also why we would run the selenium tests in this fase as well, the failsafe plugin will fail tests
    in a safe way, making sure we run the post integration closing our resources.
    As an added note we only need to specify the last fase we want to execute.
    We would also need to download a chrome/firefox.. executable.. for selenium.
</p>

<h2>
    13) Jacoco ${basedir}${fs}target${fs}jacoco-it.exec..
</h2>
<p>
    jacoco uses class file instrumentation to record execution coverage data, so jacoco agent collects execution
    information and writes it to jacoco-it then dumps it when the jvm exits thats why there is no jacoco-it file in
    frontend/target
    even though specified. its used during runtime. Its stated from their docs that this mecanism allows in memory
    pre- processing of all class files during class loading
